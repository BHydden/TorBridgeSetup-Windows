# (WIP)  TorBridgeSetup-Windows (WIP) 
(WIP) A guide to setting up a Tor bridge in Windows 10 (WIP)  
Everything in here I owe to members of the community so if you have any tips / feedback on optimizing this process at any stage, 
feel free to message me or submit a PR <3

A step by step collection of what you'll need to get a Tor bridge up and running in Windows 10, and where it can all be found.  
It's entirely possible setting up a relay is easier, but a bridge is the path I chose to go down and so that's the guide you get (for     now) ;)

## Download Links 

#### Tor (duh) 
###### You want to download the Expert Bundle (core for our bridge) as well as the Tor Browser (has some useful spare parts) 
I recommend extracting the Expert Bundle and the Tor Browser into seperate folders to avoid confusion as they have many files in common
+  https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en

#### These two links let us compile our port forwarder and obfs4 
+ Go Compiler: https://golang.org/dl/
+ Git download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
