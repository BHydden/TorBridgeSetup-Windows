(WIP) A guide to setting up a Tor bridge in Windows 10 (WIP)  
Everything in here I owe to members of the community so if you have any tips / feedback on optimizing this process at any stage, 
feel free to message me or submit a PR <3

A step by step collection of what you'll need to get a Tor bridge up and running in Windows 10, and where it can all be found.  
It's entirely possible setting up a relay is easier, but a bridge is the path I chose to go down and so that's the guide you get (for     now) ;)
